# Fast-Food-Fast 
*An Andela Developer Challenge Project* 

## Description
Fast-Food-Fast is a food delivery service app challenge built using plain HTML5, CSS, JS for front end and Node.js for the backend. The project is divided into **UI implementation** and **API Endpoints** sections with features for both demonstrated below. The overall solution is hosted on [Heroku](https://fast-food-fast-bobsar0.herokuapp.com/)

### UI Implementation
> This involves creating just the UI elements - pages and views 
#### Features
- User [signup](https://fast-food-fast-bobsar0.herokuapp.com/signup) and [login](https://fast-food-fast-bobsar0.herokuapp.com/login) pages
- [A page where a user should be able to order for food and view order history](https://fast-food-fast-bobsar0.herokuapp.com/menu)
- [A page where the admin can do the following](https://fast-food-fast-bobsar0.herokuapp.com/admin):
  - See a list of orders
  - Accept and decline orders
  - Mark orders as completed

### API Endpoints
> This involves primarily creating RESTful API endpoints to power the front-end pages.
#### Features
| Endpoints             | Functionality
| ----------------------|--------------------------------| 
| GET    /orders        | Get all orders.                | 
| GET    /orders/:id    | Fetch a specific order.        |
| POST   /orders        | Place a new order.             |
| PUT    /orders/:id    | Update the status of an order. |
| DELETE /orders/:id    | Delete an order.               |
